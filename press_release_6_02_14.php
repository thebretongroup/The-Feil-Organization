                    <img src="images/pr_images/853BroadwayMAC.jpg" class="prImage"><p class="overallP"><span class="newsDateSpan">New York, NY – June 2, 2014</span> &nbsp;<strong>M·A·C Cosmetics</strong> is staking a claim to Union Square, signing a long-term lease at 853 Broadway, announced <strong>The Feil Organization</strong>, the building’s owner and manager. The store is expected to open in time for the holiday 2014 shopping season.</p>

<p class="overallP overallP_secondP">M·A·C Cosmetics will occupy space on the ground floor, and have a two-level storefront with 25 feet of frontage along 14th Street, giving it tremendous visibility in the expanding retail district, says Brian Feil, Vice President of Leasing for The Feil Organization.
</p>


<p class="overallP overallP_secondP"><span class="quotations">“In recent years, Union Square has become a new headquarters for style. Other retailers in the area include Nordstrom Rack, lululemon athletica, an upcoming Reebok Fit Hub and CrossFit gym, and one of the best Whole Foods Markets in the country,” says Feil, who represented the building in the transaction. “M·A·C Cosmetics is a perfect complement to that fashionable shopper.”

M·A·C (Make-up Art Cosmetics), a leading brand of professional cosmetics, was created in Toronto, Canada, in 1984 and is part of The Estée Lauder Companies, Inc. The company’s popularity has grown through a tradition of word-of-mouth endorsements from makeup artists, models, photographers and journalists around the world. M·A·C is now sold in 92 countries/territories worldwide.

M·A·C was represented in the lease transaction by RKF’s Robert Cohen and Jackie Totolo.

        <p class="overallP">Some call it a magic touch. Time after time, The Feil Organization has anticipated variable market trends, and strategically acquired targeted properties to profit from them. This nearly uncanny ability to readily adapt to an ever-changing real estate market is the key reason for our 60-year track record of growth and profitability. In truth, magic has little to do with it. Our success stems from a very down-to-earth combination of insight and acumen... of diligence and expertise... and of hard work. That is what as helped us build and maintain an enviable level of performance.</p>
        
        <p class="overallP overallP_secondP">Diversity of holdings. Low debt. Operational expertise. A stable, low-turnover team. They combine to form the bedrock of The Feil Organization and elevate us above today's real estate fray. That is The Feil Organization.</p>

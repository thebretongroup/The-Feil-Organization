                    <p class="overallP">One of the benefits of financial stability is the on-going availability of ready funding. The Feil Organization’s established reputation opens doors whenever capital needs to be raised. Needless to say, we’ve built a formidable portfolio of creative financing resources for our clients and associates. We specialize in short-term, real estate-secured loans, first mortgages, mezzanine loans and preferred equity structures. Loans can be used to facilitate acquisition bridge loans, land acquisition, development and construction, bank workouts, foreclosures and bankruptcies. Through our dedicated lending platform we have the capability to provide faster funding than a traditional lender, as well as to creatively structure loans according to each client's unique set of financial circumstances.</p>

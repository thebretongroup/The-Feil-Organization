                    <p class="overallP"><span class="newsDateSpan">New York, NY – March 28, 2013</span> &nbsp;The Feil Organization has signed fast-casual
restaurant Schnipper’s Quality Kitchen to occupy 3,021 square feet of ground level retail
and storage space at its landmark 570 Lexington Avenue building, the company
announced today.</p>

<p class="overallP overallP_secondP">
Schnipper’s will open in the fourth quarter of 2013, joining upscale restaurant Mr. K’s at
the iconic office building at 51st Street, said Brian Feil, Vice President of Leasing for The
Feil Organization, who represented the company in the long-term lease. Winick Realty
Group President Steven E. Baker represented the restaurant. Asking rent for the grand
space, which features 22-foot-high ceilings, was $300 per square foot.

<p class="overallP overallP_secondP">

<span class="quotations">“We wanted a tenant that would be an amenity for the building and the area,”</span> Feil stated.
<span class="quotations">“There are not a lot of fast-casual restaurants in the area and Schnipper’s will be perfectly
situated to serve this prestigious Lexington Avenue corporate corridor.”</span>
</p>


<p class="overallP overallP_secondP">
Created by Hale & Hearty Soups founders Andrew and Jonathan Schnipper, Schnipper’s
Quality Kitchen features traditional American food, including burgers, salads, tacos,
wraps and ‘handcrafted’ milk shakes. This will be the company’s third unit.
</p>


<p class="overallP overallP_secondP">
<span class="quotations">
“We are very happy to be part of Schnipper’s Quality Kitchen’s New York expansion,”</span>
Baker said. <span class="quotations">“They are a quality tenant who will be an excellent addition to the
neighborhood.”</span>
</p>


<p class="overallP overallP_secondP">
The restaurant’s neighbors will include some of the city’s great corporate and cultural
landmarks, such as the Waldorf-Astoria, MetLife Building, Rockefeller Center, St.
Patrick’s Cathedral, the adjacent St. Bartholomew’s Church and more. It is located steps
from the 6, E and M subway lines.
</p>


<p class="overallP overallP_secondP">
Owned and managed by The Feil Organization, 570 Lexington (once the RCA Victor
Building) is one of the city’s great skyscrapers. A masterpiece of Art Deco design, the
50-story structure boasts a crown of Gothic spires (inspired by radio waves) that
resembles a giant torch when illuminated. The 640-foot-tall building, designed by Cross
and Cross, opened in 1931 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in
2004.
